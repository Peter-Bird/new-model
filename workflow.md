Here is a detailed structured description of the **Document Approval Workflow** process:

---

### **Workflow Name**: Document Approval

#### **Description**:
The workflow facilitates the review and approval of documents. It involves three main steps: submission, review, and finalization, supported by specific actors and conditions to ensure proper flow and accountability.

---

### **Steps**:

#### **1. Submit Document**
- **Objective**: To initiate the workflow by allowing a user to submit a document for review.
- **Actor**: 
  - **John Doe** (Role: User) is responsible for submitting the document.
- **Inputs**:
  - The document to be reviewed (`Document.pdf`).
- **Outputs**:
  - A confirmation that the document has been successfully submitted.
- **Process**:
  - The user uploads the document via the system.
  - A confirmation output is generated to acknowledge receipt.
- **Next Step**:
  - The workflow moves to **Step 2: Review Document**.

---

#### **2. Review Document**
- **Objective**: To evaluate the submitted document and decide whether to approve or reject it.
- **Actor**: 
  - **Jane Smith** (Role: Reviewer) is tasked with evaluating the document.
- **Inputs**:
  - The document submitted in Step 1.
- **Outputs**:
  - A decision: either `Approved` or `Rejected`.
- **Conditions**:
  - The document must pass a validity check (e.g., format, completeness).
  - Condition expression: `valid(document)`.
- **Process**:
  - The reviewer assesses the document's content.
  - Based on the review, the reviewer marks the document as either `Approved` or `Rejected`.
- **Next Step**:
  - The workflow transitions to **Step 3: Finalize Document**.

---

#### **3. Finalize Document**
- **Objective**: To perform final actions based on the review decision and notify relevant parties.
- **Actor**: 
  - **System Automation** (Role: System) is responsible for handling finalization tasks automatically.
- **Inputs**:
  - The decision from Step 2 (`Approved` or `Rejected`).
- **Outputs**:
  - A notification confirming that the document has been finalized.
  - Notifications sent to appropriate stakeholders.
- **Conditions**:
  - A decision must exist before finalization.
  - Condition expression: `decision != null`.
- **Process**:
  - If the document is **Approved**, the system:
    - Sends a notification to the user confirming approval.
    - Archives the approved document.
  - If the document is **Rejected**, the system:
    - Notifies the user about the rejection.
    - Provides feedback if necessary.
- **Next Step**:
  - None. This marks the end of the workflow.

---

### **Actors**:
1. **John Doe** (Role: User): Submits the document in Step 1.
2. **Jane Smith** (Role: Reviewer): Reviews and decides the documentâ€™s status in Step 2.
3. **System Automation** (Role: System): Finalizes the workflow based on the decision in Step 3.

---

### **Triggers**:
- The workflow starts automatically when a document is uploaded.
  - **Trigger Type**: Event-based.
  - **Trigger Criteria**: `document_uploaded`.

---

### **End State**:
- **Objective**: The workflow reaches its final state when the document is either approved or rejected, and all relevant parties have been notified.
- **Outputs**:
  - Finalized notifications.
  - Document archived if approved.

---

### **Metrics**:
1. **Total Time**: The workflow is expected to take approximately 2 hours.
2. **Completed Steps**: Tracks the number of completed steps (e.g., 2 out of 3).
3. **Pending Steps**: Tracks the remaining steps (e.g., 1 at a given time).
4. **Bottlenecks**: Identifies any steps causing delays (e.g., if Step 2 takes too long).

---

### **Summary of Flow**:
1. **Start Trigger**: Workflow begins when the user uploads a document.
2. **Step 1**: User submits the document.
3. **Step 2**: Reviewer evaluates the document and makes a decision.
4. **Step 3**: System finalizes the document's status, notifies stakeholders, and completes the workflow.
5. **End State**: Document approval or rejection is finalized, and notifications are sent.
